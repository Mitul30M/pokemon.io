Create a Random 6 Pok√©mon Team ( new gen included. ).

Want to have a Pokemon Battle to get that Gym Badge which will take you one step closer to your dream of Pokemon Champion or do you just want to test your luck and see which Pokemons you get ?!

Then this fun mini project is a right place for you to try out.. here you can generate a random 6 pokemon Team ( <b>includes new gen</b> too ).
and If you don't like a specific pokemon (or all!) in the line up; then you can even regenerate by tapping on the pokemon you want to change.

Have fun and try to <b>catch them all!</b><br><br><br><br>
